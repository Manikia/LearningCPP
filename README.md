_just learning c++_

- to run we do: `g++ .\<file name>.cpp -o "<executable name>"`
- to do casting we can do: `static casting <type>`
- we can use public or private methods when creating classes
- Constructors are used to initialize the object's data members and perform any setup required for the object to be in a valid and usable state

- constructors are basically a blue print with predefined data and you can use it anytime
